        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This game is a test of your memory. The player chooses a card and turns it over. The player then selects another card and turns it over. If the two cards are a matching pair for example two Jacks then they take the two cards and start a stack.</p>
        <p>If the cards are not a match they are turned back over and the player must try again. Each attempt will use a set amount of oxygen- make sure you guess wisely in order to survive.</p>

        <h2>Winning The Game</h2>
        <p>A player wins the game when they have collected all of the matches without depleting their oxygen.</p>
        <h2>Losing The Game</h2>
        <p>A player will lose the game if too many incorrect guesses are made and the oxygen runs out. </p>
